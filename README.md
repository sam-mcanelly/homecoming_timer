        This software was designed to aid students at Oklahoma         
        State University in tracking timecards, managing pomping     
        hours, and computing fines for students who have not         
        completed the required hours for the current week of        
        pomping.                                                     
        </p>
        <p>
        Development is ongoing, and new features will be added      
        as they are requested/created.
